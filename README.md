# Document Engine - Demo Application

A live demonstration of a proprietary **Document Engine** system, built with a decoupled architecture (Core + Angular) to solve real-world enterprise document editing challenges.

---

## 📖 Context & Goal

### The Problem

In many enterprises, especially in Banking/Finance, generating critical documents (like a "Letter of Offer") often relies on third-party rich-text editors (like CKEditor). This dependency creates several significant problems:

- **Licensing Costs:** Significant recurring annual fees.
- **Lack of Flexibility:** Being constrained by the vendor's feature set, making deep business-logic customizations difficult.
- **Technology Risk:** Reliance on a "black-box" technology introduces strategic risk and complicates deep integrations.

### The Solution

This **Document Engine** was built to solve all of these issues:

- **Business-Focused:** Built with core business features in mind, such as **"Dynamic Fields"** (`{{customer_name}}`, `{{loan_amount}}`).
- **Technological Autonomy:** Develops a proprietary Intellectual Property (IP) asset, allowing full control over the product roadmap.
- **Reduced TCO:** Completely eliminates third-party licensing costs.

---

## ✨ Features Showcase

This demo showcases the following key capabilities:

- **Rich Text Editing:** Standard formatting (Bold, Italic, Underline, etc.)
- **Business Features:**
  - **Dynamic Fields:** Insert placeholders like `{{customer_name}}` that can be replaced with real data
  - **Restricted Editing:** Control which parts of the document can be edited
  - **Read-only Mode:** View-only document presentation
- **Table Support:** Create and edit tables within documents
- **Template System:** Pre-built document templates for common use cases
- **JSON-based Data Model:** Structured document representation (not raw HTML)

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

This demo is built on a **decoupled, multi-package architecture**:

│  (Framework-Agnostic Core)          │

└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Architecture Benefits

- **Reusability:** The core logic can be reused across any future framework (React, Vue, etc.)
- **Maintainability:** Clear separation of concerns between framework-specific code and business logic
- **Testability:** Framework-agnostic core is easier to test independently
- **Flexibility:** Easy to swap or upgrade the Angular wrapper without touching core functionality

### Technology Stack

- **Core Technology:** Built on [Tiptap](https://tiptap.dev/) (a headless editor framework), which is built on top of [ProseMirror](https://prosemirror.net/)
- **Language:** 100% TypeScript
- **Framework:** Angular (for the demo application and wrapper)
- **Monorepo:** Nx workspace for efficient development
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with custom design system
